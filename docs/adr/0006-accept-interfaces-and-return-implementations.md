# 6. Accept interfaces and return implementations

Date: 2020-06-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I am still learning Go and something I read about made me realize that I might not be using about Go interfaces the way they should be used.
This artcile helped: https://github.com/Evertras/go-interface-examples/tree/master/local-interfaces  

## Decision

Define interfaces in the package in which they are used. 

## Consequences

This feels a little "backwards" to how I might use interfaces in another language, so I may not do a great job at this initially.
